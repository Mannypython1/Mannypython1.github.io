            <h1> Basketball </h1>
            <h2>Basketball history </h2>
            <p> Basketball was first invented in 1891 by Springfield College instructor and graduate student James Naismith. James Naismith wanted to invent a new game for his students that they could play inside due to the storming weather of england. Since they could not go outside, it was hard for them to play football inside because it demanded too many players and was a high risk for injury.<br><br> <img src="Images/Naismith basketball.jpg" alt="Naismith" width="700"

                This game should be simple to understand but interesting to play. The game had to be played inside and had to include several players. He also wanted this game to provide exercise for his students without it being as physical as football or rugby because he wanted to prevent injuries.<br><br>  
                
                He got his inspiration from rugby, lacrosse and a childhood game known as “duck on a rock,” which combined tag with throwing, to create what was on his mind. He asked the school janitor if he could bring him two square boxes, however, the janitor could find two boxes so instead he gave him 2 peach baskets and told him that was the closest he found to a square box. Naismith then got the idea of putting it on either side of the court. He mounted them 10 feet above the ground in the gymnasium.<br><br> <img src="Images/First hoop.jpg" alt="first hoop" width="700"

                He got the players and divided them into two teams of nine. He gave them a football and told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team’s peach basket. Then he blew the whistle. With this little to no explanation of the rules, the game had begun. It was a disaster. The players had begun fighting each other to get the ball and before anyone could score, they had a lot of injuries and a student got knocked out. <br><br>  
                
                After the game he realized that he did not want to injure the players like this. He sat down and started to write new rules for this game, and later on they would be printed and hung up in the gym. 
                He wrote a total of 13 rules on two pages and hung them up. The most important rules were that the player with the ball was not allowed to move, however, you can pass the ball wherever you want. Rule number 5 “No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute allowed.” This rule allowed the game to be clean and played with no injuries. Three consecutive fouls from one team would lead to the other team getting a point.<br><br>

                They then tried out the game with these new rules and the players had stopped tackling and fighting each other and then he had finally created the game that was just a thought at first.<br><br>  
                
                Everyone started hearing about the new game called basket ball. It was all over the news and it soon started spreading to other colleges and schools.It was the fastest spreading sport in the history of all sports. Basketball was not just for the boys, it was played a lot by women too. The Boston Globe found in 1893 to be a “very fair feminine substitute for football” since it was less physical and easier to play.<br><br>  <img src="Images/first game of basketball" alt="first game" width="700"

                Naismith was appointed as the first men's basketball coach at the University of Kansas in 1898. Ironically, he is the only men's coach in program history with a losing record. During his years as a lecturer, 13 rules began to emerge. Eventually, the bottoms of the peach baskets were cut out to make hoops, and free throws grew increasingly popular. Dribbling was invented in 1901. Originally, Naismith claimed that team numbers fluctuated from three to forty players, but five-player teams became the norm, depending on the amount of the floor area.<br><br>  
                
                Later on, the International Olympic Committee took note of the sport as it grew in popularity and included it as a demonstration event at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis. Basketball wasn't acknowledged as a medal event until 1936. Before the 1976 Montreal Olympics, women's basketball was not a medal event.<br><br>  
                
                Professional leagues were forming all throughout the country as the sport developed quickly. Basketball supporters supported their new local teams. The National Basketball Association (NBA), which had six clubs from the northeast when it was founded in 1898, was the first professional league. Only roughly five years were spent in the league. The league, which had been disbanded in 1904, was revived 33 years later, in 1937, with 13 clubs, a brand-new funding structure, and owners Goodyear, Firestone, and General Electric.<br><br>  <img src="Images/NBA first.jpg" alt="NBA" width="700"

                This is the history of basketball. How, where, and why it started. Basketball has evolved a lot since when James invented it. Now we have hoops and nets, big glass backboards, you can dribble and generation after generation are getting way better at it. It is very popular and it has reached all parts of the world. So what started with a football and peach baskets, became an international sport that is known by everyone.<br><br>
