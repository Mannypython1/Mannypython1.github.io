            <h1> RULES OF BASKETBALL </h1><br>
                <p> There are many different rules in Basketball. I am only going to cover the very basics of it:</p>
                <h2>5 players on the court</h2> 

                <p>In basketball, only a maximum of 5 players are allowed from each team on the court. Breaking this rule will result in the loss of ball possession. For instance, in low-level games when a player substitutes in and the other player doesn't get off the court in time, they would lose possession of the ball. <br>
                
                <h2>Score more than your opponent to win</h2>

                <p>To win a game, one of the teams has to score more field goals than the other team. A field goal is any scoring during the gameplay. This could be worth 1, 2 or 3 points. A free throw is worth one point and most times you get 2 shots. Any shot inside the 3-point line, the arch, is worth 2 points. Any shot behind the arch is equal to 3 points.<br>

                <h2>Score within the clock shot</h2> 

                <p>When being on offense, you have 24 seconds to make a basket. This timer is called a shot clock. If the 24 seconds pass and you still haven't made a basket or the ball didn’t touch the rim, it results in a turnover. However, if you shoot and miss and it hits the rim, the timer gets reset to 14 seconds. Now you have 14 seconds to make another basket or make the ball touch the rim. 

                <h2>The offense has five seconds to inbound the ball.</h2>
                <p>After the opposite team scores or if the ball goes out of bounds, the team inbounding the ball only has 5 seconds to pass the ball. If the player fails to pass the ball in those 5 seconds that results in a turnover, and the other team gains possession of the ball.<br>

                <h2>5 fouls maximum </h2>

                <p>Every player has a maximum of 5 fouls. Once the player commits 5 fouls he is ejected from the game and can’t play again that game. There are many fouls in basketball, offensive, defensive, technical, and flagrant fouls. Getting 5 fouls of any of these types will get you ejected.
